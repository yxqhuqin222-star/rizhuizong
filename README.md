# PM Brain

A markdown-native second brain for a product operator — a PM, product lead, or anyone accountable for one product or initiative with judgment-heavy work and scattered inputs.

## What this is

- One repo. Markdown files. Versioned with git.
- One `AGENTS.md` operating manual the agent reads at the start of every session.
- Pre-task load, post-task update — every task. No silent drift.

No vector database. No embeddings. No auto-tagging. The system is inspectable, editable, and auditable.

## How to start a session

1. Open this repo in Codex (or any agentic IDE).
2. The agent reads [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) automatically.
3. Start a task. The agent routes through [`INDEX.md`](./INDEX.md) to the relevant area.

## First-week priorities

1. **Ingest your most recent customer interview** — `/ingest interview <file>` (or paste a transcript). See what the system does with it.
2. **Prep for your next 1:1** — `/prep <highest-friction-stakeholder>`. Let it tell you what to ask.
3. **Run `/review` at the end of week one.** The maintenance sweep is where most systems quietly die. Build the habit early.

## How the system thinks

- **Working memory vs durable knowledge.** Raw ingestion lives in `ingestion/`. Only recurring, decision-relevant, strategy-relevant signals get promoted into `knowledge/`.
- **Hypotheses vs decisions.** Bets being tested live in `hypotheses/`. Commitments made live in `decisions/`. They behave differently and stay queryable separately.
- **Flag, never gate.** The system surfaces conflicts, missing hypotheses, and strategy tensions. The PM resolves them. This is a reasoning system, not a compliance system.
- **Contradictions are preserved.** When evidence genuinely conflicts, the system writes the conflict down instead of flattening it into false consensus.

```
AGENTS.md           Operating manual. Read every session.
INDEX.md            Master routing.
source/             Immutable evidence (if migrated from existing artifacts).
knowledge/          Durable, synthesized — strategy, product, users, market, org.
stakeholders/       One file per person.
hypotheses/         Feature-scoped, 5 risk areas (value/usability/feasibility/viability/other).
decisions/          Append-only log. Status: pending | decided | superseded.
rules/              How this PM runs discovery, prioritization, shipping, writing, data.
ingestion/          Working memory — interviews, meetings, market, adhoc.
maintenance/        Weekly sweep reports.
docs/               Workflows, schemas, overview, evolution guide.
Temp/               Scratch. Gitignored. Created on demand the first time you need it.
